# Field Production Operator Driving Route Optimization To Maximize Hydrocarbon Production

Oil and gas field operators face a daily challenge determining where to spend their time to have the biggest impact on increasing production.  Production disrupting incidents happen randomly and can occur with any well on any given day. Every morning operators look at each of their wellâ€™s production numbers to see if they need to address problems such as an artificial lift device being offline, separator dump valves clogging, plunger lift wells logging off, and many others. Optimizing the driving route based on production decrease and the driving time between wells creates a difficult problem due to the number of different choices. This code sample shows how to use Amazon Location Services, AWS Lambda and the python library [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/python) to produce optimized driving routes which maximize the volume of production an operator can get back online.

## Steps to deploy this repository
1. Deploy the template using the [Serverless Application Module](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/). From the root of this repository execute these bash commands:
    1. `sam build --use-container`
    1. `sam deploy --guided`
1. Look for the cloudformation stack output named `WebEndpoint`. Open this link in a web browser to get an optimized route to maximize production!
